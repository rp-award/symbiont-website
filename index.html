          The <strong>Research Symbiont Awards</strong>, given annually, recognize exemplars in the practice of data sharing. It is a companion to the <a href="http://researchparasite.com">Research Parasite Awards</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are two Research Symbiont Awards:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Early Career Clinical Research Symbiont Award</strong>: This award is <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMc1705477">restricted</a> to early career symbiotic scientists (including but not restricted to postdocs, graduate students, or recently appointed principal investigators) working on human health.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>General Symbiosis Award</strong>: This award is given to a scientist working in any field who has shared data beyond the expectations of their field. For example, we seek applications from symbiotic scientists working in sociology, ecology, astrophysics, or any other field of science.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          The process for applying for an award is described <a href="#apply">below</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Award winners will receive a travel reimbursement up to <strong>$2,500</strong> so that they may be recognized at the 2019 Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing in Hawaii. In addition, winners will receive a <strong>very</strong> cool stuffed animal.

              <strong>Applicable to both the GENERAL SYMBIOSIS AWARD and the EARLY CAREER CLINICAL RESEARCH SYMBIONT AWARD:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The sharing mechanism must be clearly permissible per all applicable ethical or legal restrictions, e.g., informed consent document.
              </li>
              <li>
                The sharing mechanism must be as easy for people who wish to use the data as is feasible within ethical and legal constraints.
              </li>
              <li>
                The dataset must be remarkable for its richness, granularity, and quality, such that it is inviting to people who wish to use the data.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the dataset is an endeavor supported by a sponsor with a conflict of interest vis a vis the results, the applicant should explain how the sharing mechanism demonstrates independence from the sponsor. If there is no such conflict of interest, the applicant should say so.
              </li>
              <li>
                Attention will be paid in the judging to whether the data were effectively re-used to answer questions not addressed in an initial publication reporting the dataset or data notification.
              </li>
              <li>
                Additional consideration will be given to datasets with the clearest publicly available audit trail of decisions potentially affecting people who wish to use the data.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Additional criteria applicable only to the EARLY CAREER CLINICAL RESEARCH SYMBIONT AWARD:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The awardee must have contributed to the dataset during the training stage of their career (prior to any faculty rank, e.g., Instructor, Clinical Lecturer, or Assistant Professor). If the awardee has assumed a faculty rank, she or he should not have been in that position for more than 3 years.
              </li>
              <li>
                The award will be based on the description of the dataset in the application letter, inspection of the dataset’s website for its access policies, and the work achieved because of data sharing (as exemplified by the PDF of a manuscript submitted with the application letter).
              </li>
              <li>
                The impact of the data sharing will be judged in part on the potential of secondary analyses to improve human health.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Additional selection criteria for the GENERAL SYMBIOSIS AWARD:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The awardee must be in an independent investigator position in academia, industry or public sector.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              By submitting an application you agree that the decisions of the Research Symbiont Award Committee are final, and the Committee is unable to provide feedback on applications that were not selected.

or even use the data to try to disprove what the original investigators had posited."

          As Isaac Newton wrote to Robert Hooke in 1675: “if I have seen further, it is by standing on the
          shoulders of giants.” <strong>The Symbiont Awards seek to honor modern giants</strong>.
       </p>
       <p>
          Traditionally, data sharing
          was challenging and expensive, so research proceeded by sharing completed findings. Our culture in
          science and medicine has been built on the value of completed stories.
          However, with the rise of networked computers, sharing complex datasets is increasingly feasible.
          Once data are shared, anyone can make discoveries from these data. This is good, at least in the
          short term, for research. Discoveries arrive sooner, and patients benefit more quickly. Discoveries
          are also more likely to emerge when they are still meaningful, before new discoveries have
          rendered them less useful. But to avoid harm in the long term, we need to make sure that incentives
          are aligned to guarantee that generating novel and interesting datasets remains rewarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          We envision a future in which widespread sharing of research data benefits all. We expect the
          biggest winners will be those who share and share well, and in doing so, create the most value.
          However, until that time comes, the Symbiont Awards seek to recognize these individuals and their
          contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis">Symbiosis</a> denotes a long-term interaction
          between two different species. The interaction may be beneficial to both or may impose a cost on
          a member of the interaction. Data sharing may impose a cost on the individual sharing, or it may
          provide benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Symbiont Awards, given annually, recognize exemplars in the practice of data sharing. We expect data sharing to play a key role in the scientific ecosystem. Some of the goals supported by data sharing include:
          <ol>
            <li>Facilitate meta-analysis and other granular, between-study analyses, even if the investigators who currently curate the data deem the project too far outside their interests* to justify a sharing effort.</li>
            <li>Facilitate validation of emerging analytical approaches. For example, in a medical context (e.g., propensity score matching) via comparison to bona fide randomized data.</li>
            <li>Facilitate independent attempts to address existing hypotheses using existing data, which can reveal previously unknown sensitivity of prior analyses to methodological assumptions ("pressure-testing" of the robustness of hypotheses; sensitivity analysis)</li>
            <li>Facilitate the generation of novel hypotheses, leading researchers to perform new studies and generate new datasets.</li>
            <li>Unburden research teams from having to handle every incoming request for data.</li>
            <li>Broaden the impact of existing data, which are often generated at great time and expense.</li>
            <li>Facilitate the emergence of important research findings faster than any one team can act to produce the results either alone or in collaboration.</li>
          </ol>
          *fundamentally in the sense of “what they enjoy thinking about”, but also, rarely, in the financial sense. The question that seems esoteric to the original study team might be highly pertinent to health in another context.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Symbiont Awards currently consist of two awards: the first recognizes an outstanding contribution
          from any research area at any level. The second seeks to recognize the sharing of data relevant to
          health by an individual at the training stage of their career — ideally a trainee with clinical
          responsibilities.

          <li>
            Members of this award committee do not serve as a
            nominator for any nomination for this award. If you have
            nominated a candidate, inform the committee chair
            immediately so that one of two actions may be taken: (a)
            the nomination will be set aside for the year, or (b) you
            will step down from the committee for the year.
          </li>
          <li>
            Members of this committee should not be directly involved
            in nominations prior to their submittal. Members can
            answer general questions about what a nomination should
            include but may not pre-review or comment on draft
            nominations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Members must maintain confidentiality about the internal
            discussions of the committee. Information about committee
            deliberations should not be shared with anyone outside the
            committee, nor should the winner be discussed until PSB
            has issued a formal statement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Members of this committee and the committee as a whole do
            not provide feedback to unsuccessful candidates. If a
            member is asked for feedback, this policy should be cited.
          </li>
          <li>
            Members of this committee are not eligible to be nominated
            for the award during their time on the committee.
            Individuals in the research group of a committee member
            are also not eligible to be nominated for the award during
            that member’s time on the committee.
          </li>
          <li>
            Members of this committee must self-identify any
            relationships/affiliations that might be perceived as a
            source of potential bias, and inform the committee chair
            of the COIs before any candidates have been discussed.
            Identify any candidates with whom you: have had close
            personal or working relationships within the past 5 years
            or the period covered by the award, whichever is longer;
            anyone for whom you were thesis advisor/advisee; anyone
            for whom you were a postdoctoral advisor/advisee; anyone
            for whom you were a faculty mentor/mentee; or any other
            case where your judgment could be affected. Also identify
            any candidates from your current institution or one where
            you worked within the past 5 years.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In the event that a committee member has a relationship
          described in rule 7 with one or more nominees, s/he should
          disclose that relationship to the other committee members
          and describe the nature of the relationship(s).  The other
          committee members should then decide (without the conflicted
          committee member) whether the conflict is adequately
          mitigated by disclosure.  In the event that a majority of
          the other committee members believes the conflict is not
          adequately mitigated by disclosure, the following procedure
          should be followed: (1) The conflicted committee member may
          not participate in the discussion of the conflicted nominee;
          (2) If the non-conflicted committee members feel a
          conflicted nominee should be an awardee, then those
          committee members should send a written description of the
          conflict and the rationale for their decision to the PSB
          co-chairs; (3) if a majority of the PSB co-chairs believe
          the decision has been improperly biased by the conflict, the
          conflicted nominee cannot be the award winner, and the
          committee will be tasked with selecting a different awardee.
